## Bootstrapping Handwritten Digits

December 2019

Machine Learning models, particularly Neural Networks, often require a lot of training data, which can be intractable to collect. With so much computational power at our fingertips, we are also able to processing more data than ever before. Essentially, a lot of data is used so that ML models can understand as much of the domain as possible. This application will employ bootstrapping as a technique for generating additional training data. The hope is that bootstrapped data can be used as a proxy for real training data.


```python
def hello():
    l = []
    for this in that:
        l.append(this.format("poo"))
```

\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= (x + 3)^{2} \\
     &= x^2 + 6x + 9
\end{aligned}
